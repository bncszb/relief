# relief

A Streamlit application created and maintained by the volunteers, who work for the Disaster Relief Department of the Hungarian Charity Service of the Order of Malta.  

This project is an ever-evolving collection of features to help the department during both in peacetime and in events like the Russo-Ukrainian War or Covid19.
